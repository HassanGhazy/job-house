    "text": "Job House allows corporates and organizations to register and fill all their respective details, edit and update those details, and set up listings for open positions they have. A listing will have all the details about the job, including the job title and all required skills. One of the favorite features of Job House is that we offer video content about companies and jobs at these companies. Also view and manage all applications sent as a response to their listings. They can reject an application or set up an interview with the applicant in order to continue with the hiHouse process outside the platform."
