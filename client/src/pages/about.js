                                <p>Job Ring Team</p>
                                <p>Job Ring® is a recruitment platform, it aims to connect students and graduates to the careers they seek and in turn help corporates and organizations fill gaps in the talent and skills they need. For a student or a graduate; Job Ring® offers the chance to explore companies and look for internships or job opportunities. For corporates and organizations; Job Ring® offers the possibility to reach out to students and graduates, explore all available skills and hunt the right talent.</p>
                                <p>We aim to give you the chance to use your knowledge in database conceptual design, logical design, and application development.</p>
                                <p>Job Ring® has a nice-looking interface that allows students and graduates to register in the platform. After they are registered, students can add or edit all personal details and education details. Job Ring® encourages students to add extensive details about their qualifications and experience. It asks for a detailed C.V., and asks the student to write detailed descriptions of all the projects he or she has worked on, the technologies he used, etc. Those descriptions can be more than a page long, and this is a good thing for Job Ring® since we use the keywords in those descriptions to find relevant student.</p>
                                <p>A registered student can view the list of companies in the platform, the list of jobs and internships offered, can perform text search and perform filters on the results, can sort the results based on different parameters, and of course he or she can apply for those opportunities. After he applies for a certain job or internship, he can track the status of his application and review the response he got.</p>
                                <p>Job Ring® also allows corporates and organizations to register and fill all their respective details, edit and update those details, and set up listings for open positions they have. A listing will have all the details about the job, including the job title and all required skills. One of the favorite features of Job Ring® is that we offer video content about companies and jobs at these companies.</p>
                                <p>Companies have the ability to view the list of registered students, they can perform text search and perform filters on the results, can sort the results based on different parameters, and they can send an advertisement to selected students they see fit for their needs.</p>
                                <p>Companies can also view and manage all applications sent as a response to their listings. They can reject an application or set up an interview with the applicant in order to continue with the hiring process outside the platform.</p>
